      <p style="font-size:20px; width: 700px; margin-top: 60px;">From garage inventors to university students and entrepreneurs, NASA is 
        looking for ideas on how to excavate the Moon’s icy regolith, or dirt,
        and deliver it to a hypothetical processing plant at the lunar South Pole.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px; width: 700px;">The NASA Break the Ice Lunar Challenge, now open for registration, is designed 
        to develop new technologies that could support a sustained human presence on the Moon 
        by the end of the decade.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px; width: 700px;">“We are excited about this opportunity to broaden our community engagement in the 
            Artemis program and explore new infrastructure approaches for the Moon,” said NASA’s Associate 
            Administrator for the Space Technology Mission Directorate Jim Reuter.</p>

     
       <p style="font-size:20px; width: 700px;" >“As outlined in our plan for sustained lunar exploration and development, NASA is 
          pursuing technology development that allows future explorers to live off the land.
          With this challenge, we’re soliciting fresh ideas from outside the traditional
          aerospace sector for acquiring and processing resources needed to support long-duration
          human surface exploration.”</p>

        <h1 style="margin-top: -30px; color: rgb(7, 72, 102);">Prize Challenge</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">The Break the Ice Lunar Challenge will take place over two phases.</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px;">Phase 1 seeks new ideas and approaches for a system architecture capable of excavating
          and moving icy regolith and water on the lunar surface. Eligible Phase 1 participants
          must submit a system architecture report, excavation plan, and mission animation by
          June 18, 2021 that addresses various operations and environmental conditions of a 
          hypothetical excavation mission on the lunar surface. The entries will compete for
          a portion of the $500,000 Phase 1 prize purse.</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px; width: 700px; margin-left: 720px;margin-top: -380px;">The initiation of Phase 2, the demonstration phase, is contingent on the emergence 
            of promising submissions in Phase 1 that demonstrate viable approaches to achieving 
            the challenge goals. Phase 2 would carry a prize purse of up to $4.5 million.</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px;width: 700px; margin-left: 720px;">The Break the Ice Lunar Challenge is a NASA Centennial Challenge, managed by
           NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and NASA’s Kennedy
           Space Center in Florida. Centennial Challenges are part of the Prizes and Challenges 
           program within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA has contracted Ensemble 
           Consultancy to support the management of competitors for this challenge.</p>
