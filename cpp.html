                C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. <br>
                C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.<br>
                C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br>
                The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.<br>

                <ol >
                    <li> The name of C++ signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C. “++” is the C increment operator.</li>
                    <li> C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.</li>
                    <li>C++ is one of the predominant languages for the development of all kind of technical and commercial software.</li>
                    <li> A function is the minimum requirement for a C++ program to run.</li>
                    <li>C and C++ invented at same place i.e. at T bell laboratories.</li>
                    <li>Many programming languages are influenced by c++, some of which include C#, Java and even newer versions of C.</li>
                    <li>Concept of reference variables: operator overloading borrowed from Algol 68 programming language.</li>
                    <li>A major reason behind success of C++ is that it supports various programming styles. It is a multiparadigm programming language that not only supports OOP paradigm but also many other paradigms.</li>

            <h2>Benifits of C++: </h2><hr><br><br>
            <h3><strong>1. C++ Popularity and High Salary</strong></h3>
            <p><em>
              
                C++ is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by some
                 4.4 million developers worldwide. Also, C++ Developers are quite sought after 
                 and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry with an average 
                 base pay of $103, 035 per year.
                </em>
            </p><br>
            <br>
            <h3> <strong>2. C++ has Abundant Library Support</strong> </h3>
            <p><em>
                C++ has the Standard Template Library(STL) that is very useful as it helps in writing
                 code compactly and quickly as required. It contains mainly four components i.e. algorithms,
                  containers, functions, and iterators.
                  </em>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3><strong>3. C++ has a Large Community</strong></h3>
            <p><em>
                There is a large online community of C++ users and experts that is particularly helpful in case
                 any support is required. There is a lot of resources like
                 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks</a>etc. available on the internet
                  regarding C++. Some of the other online resources for C++ include 
                  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2B%2B" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>,
                  <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/" target="_blank">cppreference.com</a>, 
                 <a href="https://isocpp.org/" target="_blank">Standard C++</a>,etc.
                
            </em></p><br><br><br>
            <h3><strong>4. C++ In Databases</strong></h3>
            <p style="width:844px"><em>There are many modern day databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, MemSQL, etc. that are written in C++. 
                This is because C++ is quite modern and it supports features like exceptions, lambda expressions, etc.
            </em></p>

            <br><br><br>
            <h3><strong>5. C++ In Operating Systems</strong></h3>
            <p><em>All the major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Android, Ubuntu, iOS, etc. are written in a
                 combination of C and C++. The Windows applications are written in C++, while Android applications are 
                 written in Java along with C/C++ with non-default run-times for C++ support. Also, C++ can be used to 
                 develop the core of the applications in iOS.
            </em></p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3><strong>6. C++ In Compilers</strong></h3>
            <p><em>C++ is closer to the hardware level and is a comparatively low-level language. Because of this reason,
                 it is used in many compilers as a backend programming language. An example of this is the
                 <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/" target="_blank">GNU Compiler 
                    Collection (GCC)</a>which is currently written mostly in C++ along with C.
            </em></p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3><strong>7. C++ In Web Browsers</strong></h3>
            <p><em>A lot of web browsers are developed using C++ such as <strong>Chrome, Firefox, Safari,</strong> etc. 
                Chrome contains C++ in the rendering engine, JavaScript engine, and the UI. Firefox uses mainly in the 
                rendering engine and a little in the UI. Safari also uses C++ in the rendering engine and JavaScript 
                engine.
            </em></p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3><strong>8. C++ In Graphics</strong></h3>
            <p style="width:855px"><em>Applications requiring graphics such as digital image processing, computer vision, screen recording 
                programs, etc. use C++ due to its high speed. This can also include different games that have graphics
                 as a big part of their structure.
            </em></p>

            <h3><strong>9. C++ In Embedded Systems</strong></h3>
            <p style="width:844px"><em>C++ is closer to the hardware level and so it is quite useful in embedded systems as the software
                 and hardware in these are closely coupled. There are many embedded systems that use C++ such as smart 
                 watches, MP3 players, GPS systems, etc.

            <h3><strong>10. C++ is Portable</strong></h3>
            <p><em>Programs developed in C++ can be moved from one platform to another. This is one of the main reasons
                 that applications requiring multi-platform or multi-device development often use C++.</em></p>
