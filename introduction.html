        <h2>What is Java?</h2>

        <p style="width: 700px;"><u>Java</u> is a computer programming language. It enables programmers to write computer instructions
          using English-based commands instead of having to write in numeric codes. This language is free to 
          access and can run on all platforms.It’s known as a high-level language because it can be read and 
          written easily by humans.</p>

        <p style="width: 700px;">Like English or any other language, Java has a set of rules that determine how the instructions are written. These 
           rules are known as its syntax. Once a program has been written, the high-level instructions 
           are translated into numeric codes that computers can understand and execute.</p>

        <h2>Who created Java?</h2>
        <img src="j2.jpg" alt="java" width="600px" height="300px;" >

        

        <p style="width: 700px;margin-left: 780px;margin-top:-250px;">In the early 90s, Java, which originally went by the name Oak and then Green, was created by 
            a team led by James Gosling for <abbr title="Sun Microsystems">SM</abbr> a company now owned by Oracle. Java was originally
            designed for use on digital mobile devices, such as cellphones. However, when Java 1.0(first version of Java)
            was released to the public in 1996, its main focus had shifted to use on the internet, providing
            interactivity with users by giving developers a way to produce animated web pages.Over the years Java has evolved way too
            much.</p>
       
        <h2 style="margin-top:60px;">Why you should choose Java? </h2>

        <p >Java is concurrent where you can execute many statements instead of sequentially executing it.
            Class-based and an object-oriented programming language. Class-based and an object-oriented.
            There are some other main keys why programmers should choose Java as a programming language in their future projects or applications that they are
            going to develop:</p>
        <ol style="border: solid 4px;
        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141); 
        background-color: aliceblue;width: 640px;">
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It is reliable</li>
            <li>It is secure</li>
            <li>It is an independent platform</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Where you should start?</h2>
        <p style=" width: 670px;">If you want to start programming in Java, first you need to download and install the Java development kit.</p>
        <p style=" width:670px;">To download and install Java in Windows, Linux or Mac you can check the instructions in the link below:

        <p  style="margin-top:-400px; margin-left:670px; ">Java is classified as a <mark> "general purpose"</mark> language, meaning that it can be used for almost anything.
            It was designed for flexibility, allowing developers to write code that would run on any machine,
            regardless of architecture or platform. According to the Java home page, more than 1 billion 
            computers and 3 billion mobile phones worldwide run Java.
            For a number of reasons, Java is not suited to do kernel device drivers and other system programs,
            but aside of that, there is not much you can’t do if you really want to.That said, we old hacks
            have a saying: <mark>“If your only tool is a hammer, all you see is nails”.</mark> While Java could be used 
            for a lot of things, that does not mean it is appropriate to use for a lot of things. Windowed 
            programs, for example, aren’t Java strong point: if you look at the horrific Oracle Forms or 
            even just <abbr title="Structured Query Language Developer">SQL Developer</abbr>  (the program that Oracle ships to manage their databases and schemas)
            you will quickly realize why is this.Mostly, Java is useful for the web and for Android
            applications (even though the latter are also processed via a special virtual machine, not
            standard ones)</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-left:670px;  ">Some other applications of Java are listed below:
            <b>Banking, Retail, Information Technology, Financial services and Research.</b></p>
        
       
         <p style="color: black; text-align: center; font-size: 38px;

             Do not forget that Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. </p>
      

        <p style="margin-top:-80px; margin-left:650px; ">When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate
           via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods, 
           and instance variables mean in the next page.</p>
