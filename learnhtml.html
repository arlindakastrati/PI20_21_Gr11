        <h3>About the Web</h3>
        <p style="width: 750px;">The purpose of this page is to introduce you to basic concepts of web programming, using
            fundamental technologies such as HTML and CSS. As already known, web is quite pervasive not just
            for building websites but also for fully-fledged web applications. Today’s web technologies support
            development of quite advanced applications that at some point were only possible for native platforms
            such as Desktops and mobile devices.

           In this page we are going to learn the basics of<strong>two fundamental</strong>technologies of the web
            called HTML and CSS. These are not programming languages per se, rather they are what we call
            markup and stylesheet languages, which mostly have to do with how a webpage looks, instead of how
            it works.</p>

         <p style="width: 750px;">As you already know, websites and web applications require you to use a web browser in order to
            access them.</p>
         <p> In a nutshell, the moment you write an address in the address bar and hit Enter, what
            happens in the background is that the browser communicates with the computer (server) that hosts the
            website at that address (e.g. google.com) and requests the files to run the website. </p>
            
            
         <p>Those files are at the very least a bunch of HTML and CSS files (and of course some other file types but 
            you’ll learn about those later).The server sends back the HTML and CSS, and the browser parses them and displays the
            web-page to you. If you know a little bit about programming languages, you may have noticed that
            there is no compilation or anything of the such in this case. At most, here we have to do with
            interpretation, i.e. the browser interpreting whatever code is being served from the server.</p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        
        <p>
            HTML is one of the essential languages in the web that allows us to build the structure of our website.
            It is not a programming language, rather its what its called a <mark style="background-color: rgb(158, 158, 231);">“markup language”.</mark> Itstands for<strong>Hyper
            Text Markup Language.</strong>We use HTML to simply describe the building blocks of our site, such as
            menus, links, etc. This means that HTML is not concerned at all with any details about how a
            component should look, i.e. whether it should have a red or a black background. There is another way 
            to do that. With HTML all we care about is describing how our website is structured. You can easily
            check the HTML of websites you use daily. Just right click somewhere on the page and find a menu
            item named<mark style="background-color: rgb(158, 158, 231);">“View page source”</mark>. A new window will open with the HTML structure of the page. Some
            (such as Facebook) have very complex HTML (that is probably auto-generated by other software), but
            there are others (such as Wikipedia) that are easier to understand.

        <h1 style="font-size: 37px;color:lightblue;margin-top:-280px;">“Let us take you into a deeper experience, make this moment a lasting conveyable memory by learning HTML."</h1>
        <h3>Html Structure</h3>
        <p>HTML is composed of<strong>elements.</strong>These elements structure the page and define its content. Each
            element is comprised of a tag and content.</p>

         <img src="12.jpg" alt="Html Tag" width="600" height="400" >
         <p class="speeech" style="font-size: 44px;line-height: 40px;margin-top:20px;">“There are five important things for living a successful 
            and fulfilling life: never stop dreaming, never stop believing, never give up,
             never stop trying, and never stop learning.” 
         </p>
        <p style="margin-top:-280px;">
            The tag usually explains the content that is within them. They usually come in pairs, i.e. an opening tag
            and a closing tag. The purpose of an opening and a closing tag is to simply specify where the element
            begins and where it ends. Looking at the above image, we can easily understand that this element is a
            paragraph (although a one-line one). We add an opening and a closing tag to it to describe it to the
            browser, that this part of the raw text is a paragraph we’re talking about, so that the browser knows
            how to handle it, but most importantly, because we may need to change the looks of it at the very near
            future.
            What happens under the hood is that when the browser displays a webpage, it reads the HTML code
            from a text file, and looks for special codes or tags that are marked with<hightli < and > signs. There is a set of
            accepted tags that the browser knows how to display, for instance the paragraph tag we’ve seen above.
            The browser simply takes those, gives them some default looks (and maybe functionality) and displays
            them on the browser window.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Files</h3>
        <p>HTML code is written in HTML files, which are nothing more than simple text files that end with the
            extension<strong>.html.</strong>
            You can go ahead and try it yourself right now.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open <b>Notepad++</b> (install Notepad++ or any other editors that are listed below)
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Komodo Edit</b></li>
                    <li><b>Apache NetBeans</b></li>
                    <li><b>Visual Studio Code</b></li>
                    <li><b>Bluefish</b></li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Write the paragraph we saw before
            </li>
            <li>Save the file. Name it however you want, just make sure that it ends with .html. Save it
                somewhere you can easily access it.</li>
            <li>You’ll see that it usually gets the icon of your default browser (Chrome, or Firefox, or IE). Double
                click on it. It’ll open in your default browser and you’ll see the above paragraph</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="0.jpg" alt="Html syntax" width="600" height="400">

        <p class="speeeech" style="left:700px;top:-170px;font-size: 25px;">You have come so far!</p>
        <p class="speeeeech" style="left:1200px;top:-400px;font-size: 25px;">You can do it!</p>
        <p class="speeeeeech" style="left:950px; top: -780px;font-size: 25px;">Believe in yourself!</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:-550px">The Body</h3>

        <p >We’ve learned a bit about the paragraph tag, however, its not a recommended practice to just throw
            these tags in the HTML file. Fortunately, browsers are very forgiving and don’t require a strict
            structure, and will probably display whatever tags you put, and even with minor mistakes. However, its
            good to follow best practices when it comes to building websites due to numerous reasons, such as
            maintainability, and accessibility</p>
        
        <p>Each HTML document has a basic structure. If you click on a website, you’ll see that
            this is probably the case. The structure is as follows:</p>
            <img src="3.jpg" alt="Html Body" width="600" height="400">
            <img src="14.jpg" alt="Html Body" width="600" height="400" style="margin-left: 210px;" >

        

        <p>First, the top-most tag is the HTML tag, that describes that this is an HTML document. Inside that there
            are two important parts, namely the head and the body (described by their respective tags). The purpose
            of these two tags is mainly descriptive, i.e. in most cases they don’t have any specific functionality.
            However, usually in the head we put HTML elements that are not to be displayed to the user, such as
            metadata about the page (i.e. the page title that is shown in the browser tab). On the other hand, we use
            the body to put elements that are at one point or another displayed to the user.</p>
        
            <img src="15.jpg" alt="Html structure of body" width="600" height="400">


            <img src="2.jpg" alt="Htmlcontent of body" width="600" height="400" style="margin-left: 220px;">
            
        <p>From the above, you’ve also implicitly learned that HTML tags can be nested, i.e. they can be
            composed of other tags as well. You might’ve already understood that this is the case by viewing the
            source of already existing websites. See below an example of how such structure is put into use.
            </p>

            <img src="4.jpg" alt="Html Comments" width="600" height="400">

            <p class="speeechh" style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 42px;">Just a little reminder to everyone that anything is possible, 
                especially when you’ve hit a wall with your code and feel like you’re getting nowhere.👍</p>

        <p style="margin-top: -230px;">Try copying and pasting this code in an HTML file and run it in the browser. Notice how the title is
            changed in the browser tab. Apart from this, there is not much change from your previous HTML file,
            however, the structure is more compliant with the HTML standard, and we can be sure that different
            browsers will display the site properly.
            </p>

        <h3>Headings</h3>

        <p>We’ve already learned a bit about HTML structure and a basic tag to display paragraphs. Let’s see
            some that allow us to display headings. Paste the following code in a new HTML file and see what
            happens.</p>
        <img src="5.jpg" alt="Html Headings" width="600" height="400">
        <img src="17.jpg" alt="Html Headings" width="600" height="400" style="margin-left: 220px;">
        
        
        <p>
            These tags help us structure our documents better, whereby we use them to describe titles in our
            webpage. You’ll see that the browser gives them a default styling, i.e. h1 has a larger font than h2.
            However, always remember that HTML is about structure and not about looks. If you want to display a
            smaller looking title, but which is still considered to be a first-level heading, do not use a smallerlooking tag, like an h4. For the beginning you could, however, its good to be aware that this is not a
            good practice, as the looks of the tags are supposed to be altered using CSS (which we’ll get to know
            later).
        </p>

        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>We’ve already seen paragraphs, however its worth knowing that whenever a browser encounters a
            paragraph tag, it inserts a blank line then begins a new line. Try pasting the following code (which has
            two paragraphs) to see how the browser displays them</p>
        <img src="6.jpg" alt="Html Paragraphs" width="600" height="400">
        <img src="18.jpg" alt="Html Paragraphs" width="600" height="400" style="margin-left: 220px;">
        

        <h3>Text breaks</h3>
        <p>There are cases where we need to display a line break but not necessarily a new paragraph. There is a
            tag in HTML that does just that and its named <strong><mark style="background-color: rgb(158, 158, 231);">“br”</strong>.This is also a different type of tag in that it does
            not require a closing tag. We also call them empty tags. Try placing one somewhere inside a paragraph
            and observe what happens.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: -300px;">Comments</h3>

        <p>You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
            <strong><mark style="background-color: rgb(158, 158, 231);" >!-- Write your comments here --</mark></strong>Notice that there is an exclamation point (!)
            in the start tag, but not in the end tag.Comments are not displayed by the browser,
            but they can help document your HTML source code
            Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code,
            one at a time, to search for errors.
        </p>

        <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
        <img src="30.png" alt="Html Tips" width="150px" height="200px" style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Notepad++ is an excellent, free program, which acts like a regular notepad, 
                but you can save and test your code live in a browser. (It also allows almost
                 any coding language. HTML, CSS, python, Javascript, etc. )</li>
            <li>You might like to try finding a simple webpage on the Internet, and 
                playing around with the code. Try moving some text, changing the font,
                 altering images, anything that takes your fancy!</li>
            <li>You could get a notebook and write all the codes down, 
                so that if you need reminding, you can just open your notebook and see.
                 You could also print this page out as a helpful point of reference.</li>
            <li>When coding, make sure you lay your code out neatly, so that it is
                 possible for you and others to understand it. Use <!-- Insert comment here --> 
                 for HTML comments, which don't show up in the webpage, but do in the code.</li>
            <li>XML and RSS are becoming more and more common on websites these days. 
                Their code may seem tough to read and understand to the human observer,
