        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141);  background-color: aliceblue;">As we said earlier,computers only understand 0s and 1s.At the same time,humans are not usually able to express instructions,let alone complex
            programs only in )s and 1s, hence the need for higher level programming languages.We believe that the general ideas is that there is a third party
            in play,which meditates between computers and programmers.This party basically translates whatever instruction human write,into a language that computers
            understand(namely 0s and 1s).We call this process of translation,compilation and this "third party"compilers.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 700px; border: solid 4px;margin-top: 30px;
        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141);   background-color: aliceblue;">Basically, what compliers do boils down to translating from one language to another.So, in a typical programming language,the compiler
            would take the program you write in a higher level programming language, and translate that to 0s and 1s so that the computer 
            can execute it. At the same time, comppilers do a through check of your codes to spot any possible mistakes and alert you before-hand.

        <h2 style="margin-left: 850px; margin-top: -430px;">Program compilation in Java</h2>
        <p style=" width:650px;margin-left: 780px;border: solid 4px;
        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141); background-color: aliceblue;">Java is slightly different from
             typical programming languages,in that the code is not directly translated into code that is understood by
            machines. Java has an interesting selling point, in that programs that are written in Java designed to run on different machines(with different
            operating systems). There is even a motto that says "write once,run anywhere".Typically, with other programming languages, you'd end up writing 
            a program for Windows, and then rewriting it in for another platform(such as Mac OS). As you understand,this is not very practical, as today There
            are at least 3-4 different operating systems(platforms) that users prefer to use, and having to write a copy of your program for each of them is not
            a trival task, especially if the program is complex, such as Microsoft Word.

        </p>
        <p style=" margin-top:30px;border: solid 4px;
        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141);  background-color: aliceblue;">In order to enable the "write once run anywhere" 
            paradigm,Java introduces the concept of JVM(Java Virtual Machine).To put simply, this is a program
            that must be installed in your computer in order to run programs written in Java. Fortunately, most computers come with Java preinstalled,
            however it is very easy to install if not present.
        </p>
        <p style="border: solid 4px;
        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141);  background-color: aliceblue;">In Java, it is the JVMs responsibility to
             abstract underlying operating system differences and intricacies and translate code to something that 
            the specific machine can understand. Hence, when we compile our Java programs,we are not actually compiling them to 0s and 1s, rather to an 
            intermediary language called byte code, that the JVM is able to understand and interpret it differently depending on the platform it is installed.

        <p >To summarize the above, there are three steps to be followed whenever we are writing any simple or complex 
            programs:</p>
            <h4>1. Write it</h4>
        <p > At this step, we write the program in Java, using a simple editor(such as Notepad). Professional programmers usually use 
            something more complex such as an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) to help them with repetitive tasks, however a simple editor should be more
            than enough for us.</p>
          <h4 >2. Compile it</h4>
        <p > At this step, we invoke the services of another program(the compiler) to translate our source code to byte code, so that 
            the JVM can execute it.</p>
        
          <h4 >3. Run(execute) it</h4>
         <p> After we've compiled the source code successfully,we tell the computer to execute the instructions 
            using JVM.</p>

        <p style="border: solid 4px;
        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141);  background-color: aliceblue;">This is our first , and very simple program, that does nothing more than print <mark style="background-color: lightblue;">
        "Hello World".</mark> The console is a text box where the output of our program is printed and is named differently in different operating
         systems. For example in Windows, they call it <b>Command Prompt</b> where as in othere systems(such as Mac IOS) it is called
        <b>Terminal</b> The important thing to know is that this place from where we can run our programs,observe the output that is generated
        from our programs, and even provide input to them either before or during their execution.</p>

        <p style="border: solid 4px;
        border-color:  rgb(38, 115, 141);  background-color: aliceblue;">There are two ways to call <b>println</b> with or without arguments.</p>

              "My original postulate, which I have been pursuing as a scientist all my life, 
                is that one uses the criteria of correctness as a means of converging on a decent 
                programming language design one which doesnâ€™t set traps for its users, and ones 
                in which the different components of the program correspond clearly to different 
                components of its specification, so you can reason compositionally about it. [...]
